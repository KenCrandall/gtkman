Installation
------------

To install, just run:

 ./compile.sh

followed by:

 ./install.sh

as root. You can set DESTDIR to change the installation target:

DESTDIR=/my/custom/installation/target ./install.sh

NOTE
----
The installed gtkman executable is a python script. It expects
python 2.x to be installed and the default python interpreter.
If you have python 3.x as the default python interpreter, you
can change the first line in the gtkman code to point to the
python 2.x executable.
