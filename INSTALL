Installation
============

To install, just run:

    make

followed by:

    make install

as root.

You cat set PREFIX and PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR environment variables in
a similar manner when running "make install" to specify the general
prefix and localization files locations respectively. Default values for
these are:
    PREFIX=/usr/local
    PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR=/usr/share/locale

You can also set DESTDIR to change the installation target. Here's an
example:

    make install DESTDIR=/my/custom/installation/target PREFIX=/usr


NOTE
====

The installed gtkman executable is a python script. It expects
python 3.x to be installed.
