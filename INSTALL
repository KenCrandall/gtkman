Installation
============

To install, just run:

    make

followed by:

    make install

as root. You can set DESTDIR to change the installation target:

    make install DESTDIR=/my/custom/installation/target

NOTE
====

The installed gtkman executable is a python script. It expects
python 2.x to be installed and the default python interpreter.
If you have python 3.x as the default python interpreter, you
can change the first line in the gtkman code to point to the
python 2.x executable.
