Installation
============

To install, just run:

    make

followed by:

    make install

as root. You can set DESTDIR to change the installation target:

    make install DESTDIR=/my/custom/installation/target

You can also set PREFIX and PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR environment variables in
a similar manner when running "make install" to specify the general
prefix and localization files locations respectively. Default values for
these are:
    PREFIX=/usr/local
    PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR=/usr/share/locale

NOTE
====

The installed gtkman executable is a python script. It expects
python 2.x to be installed and the default python interpreter.
If you have python 3.x as the default python interpreter, you
can change the first line in the gtkman code to point to the
python 2.x executable.
